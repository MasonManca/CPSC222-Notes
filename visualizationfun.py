EDA- explatory data analysis
getting familiar with your data
    exploring it

goals:
    1) clearly and accurately represent data
    2) be creative, with the goal of increasing readability and understanding
    3) Label the units and points of interest

some jargon
chart: a 2d visualization
plot: a chart with data points (e.g. scatter plot)
graph: a chart for a mnathfunction (e.g. sine)

we will use the matplotlib library for charting w/python

3 ways to use matplotlib
1) using the pyplot module (what data scientists typically use)
*there is always a "current" figure*
2) using the oop interface
3) a mix of the first two

Normal Distributions:
    * mean = median = mode
    * Symmetric about the center
        Can apply conclusions made on one side to the other side
    * 50% less than mean and more than mean
    * Area under the curve is 1
    Given a sample of observations, we can compute many standard deviations a single observation x, is form the mean
    Z score - x- mean/ stdv
T-Distribution:
    *Like a Z distribution based on a certain number called the degrees of freedom.
        * n is the sample size
            *as n increases, so does your degrees of freedom, making a t distribution looking more and more like a z distribution
        
    -When to use a t-dist instead of a z-dist
        *Sample size is small < 30
        *When you don't know your population standard deviation (sigma)
        *When a normal distribution it is safe to use a t-dist
